# Luncha-I-Mjardevi-Scraper
This repo contains the scrapers used by [lunchaimjardevi.com](https://lunchaimjardevi.com).  
They are set up to be used within a [Powershell Universal](https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal) server.  
The only thing missing in this repo is the file PushToDB.ps1that is used only for uploading the info to the database and a PSU secret variable containing the OCR API key

I am making this open source mainly to make it easier for others to contribute their favorite restaurants and because people have asked how it works.

**If you are only interested in getting todays menu please use the lunchaimjardevi api instead**, it is free and won't cause any strain on the restaurants servers.
