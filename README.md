# Luncha-I-Mjardevi-Scraper
This repo contains the scrapers used by lunchaimjardevi.com. 
They are set up to be used within a Powershell Universal server
The only thing missing in this repo is the file PushToDB.ps1 that is used only for uploading the info to the database

I am making this open source mainly to make it easier for others to contribute their favorite restaurants and because people have asked how it works.

**If you are only interested in getting todays menu please use the lunchaimjardevi api instead**, it is free and won't cause any strain on the restaurants servers.
